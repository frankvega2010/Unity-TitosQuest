# Tito's Quest
## An Unity Game for a College Assigment.

This is a small project , which it will include manipulation of the rotation of objects with the use of the mouse button.
We are also learning to use new tools that can make understand our code in an easier way and make a correct design pattern.

A simple defense game,nothing out of the ordinary.
